I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the Colorado School of Mines, working with Professor Ning Lu. I received my Ph.D. in Civil Engineering (Geotechnical Engineering) from The Pennsylvania State University in May 2025, under the supervision of Professor Ming Xiao.

My research interests focus on understanding the fundamental mechanical and physical behaviors of geomaterials, such as frozen soils, and on developing integrated tools to assess the engineering and socioeconomic impacts of permafrost degradationâ€“induced geohazards on civil infrastructure. My research is fundamentally interdisciplinary, and I aim to contribute to the development of resilient coastal communities. I have worked with engineers, geophysicists, and social scientists to address critical challenges related to landslides, coastal erosion, flooding, and infrastructure resilience and adaptability.

Specifically, I develop a physically constrained geomechanical model based on field testing, laboratory testing, and numerical modeling to assess the effects of thaw settlement and bearing capacity reduction resulting from permafrost degradation.
