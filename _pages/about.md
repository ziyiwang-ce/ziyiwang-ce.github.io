<img src="/images/title_fig.png" alt="Title figure" style="width:100%; max-height:300px; object-fit:contain; display:block; margin:0 auto;">

I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the Colorado School of Mines, working with Professor Ning Lu. I received my Ph.D. in Civil Engineering (Geotechnical Engineering) from The Pennsylvania State University in May 2025, under the supervision of Professor Ming Xiao.

My research interests focus on understanding the fundamental mechanical and physical behaviors of geomaterials, such as frozen soils, and on developing integrated tools to assess the engineering and socioeconomic impacts of permafrost degradation–induced geohazards on civil infrastructure. I conduct interdisciplinary research, and I aim to contribute to the development of resilient coastal communities. I have worked with engineers, geophysicists, and social scientists to address critical challenges related to permafrost degradation, coastal erosion, flooding, landslides, and infrastructure resilience and adaptability.

Research
=======


Specifically, I develop user-friendly infrastructure hazard maps to quantify infrastructure risks at high resolutions to support science-based decision-making and policymaking. The physics-constrained geomechanical model applied in large-scale mapping and risk assessment was established based on field testing, laboratory testing, and process-based modeling. My research mainly focuses on:
1. I developed the 21st-century high-resolution geomechanical modeling framework to assess the infrastructure geohazards, including thaw settlement and bearing capacity in northern Alaska.
![Modeled bearing capacity reduction across northern Alaska communities](/images/brca_communities.png)



2. I proposed the cryostress concept to unify frozen soils’ behaviors at different temperatures. The concept is analogous to the suction stress concept, which was developed from interparticle force equilibrium, considering physicochemical and mechanical interactions.
![Soil freezing regimes and cryostress as a function of soil freezing curve](/images/cryostress_concept.png)



3. I participated in fieldwork on the Arctic Coastal Plain in northern Alaska to retrieve relatively undisturbed permafrost cores and conduct multichannel surface wave analysis. I investigated the geomechanical and geophysical behavior of undisturbed permafrost in situ and in the laboratory.

4. I developed multiphysical models to understand permafrost thaw consolidation behaviors, considering adsorptive and capillary unfrozen water and secondary compression behavior.

5. I developed the Arctic Coastal Hazard Index, an integrated tool to assess the Arctic coastal vulnerability considering the compound effects of permafrost thaw, coastal erosion, and flooding.
